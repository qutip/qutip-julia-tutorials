## Introduction

The Hamiltonian $H$ is given by

$$
H = \hbar \omega \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}.
$$

We start by importing the packages:

```{julia}
using QuantumToolbox
```

Here we use units where $\hbar = 1$, and `ω = 1.0`:

```{julia}
ω = 1.0
a = destroy(5)
H = ω * a' * a
```

## Version Information
```{julia}
QuantumToolbox.versioninfo()
```
